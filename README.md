# gobject-introspection-m4
GObject introspection is a middleware layer between C libraries (using GObject) and language bindings. The C library can be scanned at compile time and generate metadata files, in addition to the actual native C library. Then language bindings can read this metadata and automatically provide bindings to call into the C library. https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection
